# OpenCLSim

Open Source Complex Logistics Simulation - Rule driven scheduling of cyclic activities for in-depth comparison of alternative operating strategies.

Documentation can be found [here](https://openclsim.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

To install OpenCLSim, run this command in your terminal:

``` bash
pip install openclsim
```

This is the preferred method to install OpenCLSim, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don’t have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.

You can read the [documentation](https://openclsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for other installation methods.

## Examples

The benefit of OpenCLSim is the generic set-up. This set-up allows the creation of complex logistical flows. A number of examples are presented in a seperate [Jupyter Notebook repository](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/OpenCLSim-Notebooks). Information on how to use the notebooks is presented in that repository as well.
